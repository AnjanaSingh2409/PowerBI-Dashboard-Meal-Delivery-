# PowerBI-Dashboard-Meal-Delivery-

Here's the problem statement:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their 
customers.
The client wants to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centers will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.

The replenishment of most raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance.
Secondly, staffing of the centers is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are helpful.
 
We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:

Historical data of demand for a product-canter combination
Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount
Information for fulfillment centers like center area, city information, etc.

Our report/dashboard should answer the following questions posed by the sales director of the client:

Q.1. What is the total number of orders catered by the firm? There should be a date filter in the dashboard.

Q.2. What is the revenue earned by the firm?

Q.3. What is the total discounted value (base price - check out price) * number of orders?

Q.4. What is the overall discount %?

Q.5. What are the top 5 selling categories?

Q.6. Does the operational area of the store influence number of orders?

Q.7. Are emails & product features on the homepage an effective mode of promotion?

Q.8. What will be the next 5 weeks forecasted weekly quantity sold for each center, city, and meal category (you may use a simple trend-based forecasting method)?
